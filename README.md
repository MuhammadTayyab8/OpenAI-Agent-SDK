# **OpenAI Agent SDK Course**

OpenAI Agent SDK is a **Python library** designed for building intelligent agents using OpenAI models.
This repository contains a **complete step-by-step course** on creating agents, integrating tools, managing memory, and advanced agent workflows.

---

## **What Here**

* How to **set up the environment** for OpenAI SDK
* How to **work with APIs** and configure models
* Building **basic and advanced agents**
* Adding **tools, memory, and structured outputs**
* Implementing **guardrails and lifecycle management**
* **Streaming, cloning agents, and UI integration** with Chainlit
* Deploying agents and using external tracing providers

## ðŸ›  **Basic Setup**

### **1. Install UV (Virtual Environment Tool)**

UV is a fast virtual environment and dependency management tool. Install UV by running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

---

### **2. Create and Activate Virtual Environment**

Inside your project folder:

```bash
uv venv
```

Activate the environment:

* **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* **Mac/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

---

### **3. Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install openai chainlit python-dotenv
```

---

### **4. Get API Key**

1. Go to **Google AI Studio** â†’ [https://aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Generate an **API key**
3. Add it to your `.env` file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY="AI..........."
```

---

### **5. Base URL for Gemini (OpenAI-Compatible)**

Copy the Base URL from:
[https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/openai)
Add to `.env`:

```
BASE_URL="https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai/"
```
